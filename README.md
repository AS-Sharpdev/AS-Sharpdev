# 👋 Hey, I'm A.S. Sharpdev  

I create fun and educational **C# & WinForms tutorials** on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmK2twdLhdEMH5x0iqfw2A)) 🎥.  
If you’re learning C# and want practical projects (games, tools, modern UI tricks) — you’re in the right place!

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m a **professional software developer with 15+ years of experience** working in a large company.  
Over the years, I’ve gained a wide range of knowledge in:  
- ✅ **C# / .NET / WinForms**  
- ✅ **Game development with Unity**  
- ✅ **Modern software technologies & architecture**  

Coding isn’t just my job — it’s also my passion.  
Privately, I love building creative projects in C#, experimenting with **game development**, and staying curious about the latest tech trends. 🚀  

On YouTube and GitHub, I share this knowledge through **hands-on, project-based tutorials** so others can learn the way I did:  
by **building real things**.
